Installation

- enable module in Drupal
- after the normal install you need to apply a patch to the core comment.module  

  you need - the GNU patch module (e.g. from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm for windows)
  
  then copy the patch file to the modules dif (where comment.module lies)
  
  and type ina cmd box
  
  patch -p0 < comment.module.patch
  
  when it asks 
  
    File to patch:
    
  you type in again
  
    comment.module 
    
  as the comment.module is obviously newer than when the patch was created you
